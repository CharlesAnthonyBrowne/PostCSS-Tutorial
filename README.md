# Gulp
Once you've git cloned the project and cd into the directory type `gulp` to run both the css compile task and the watch task.
Make any changes in the stylesheet and the watch task will automatically pick up changes and recompile.

# SASS
Within the SASS directory you'll see a few random SASS functions, but the same overall stylesheet.
This stylesheet is just to show some functions that are perfectly fine and can be helpful that are over engineering CSS and can mean an FE developer needing to take extra time to learn SASS syntax.

# PostCSS
PostCSS is just plain CSS. I'm writing plain CSS in `main.css` however, i'm able to use `$variables` that i'm used to using from SASS.
This is achieveble via our gulp task.

# PostCSS - Downside
The only negative i've found is the extra time needed to take setting up the gulp task. But this can be easily overcome with a slight learning curve.
